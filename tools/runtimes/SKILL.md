Rule: prove the package runs under Node and Bun with `deno task runtimes`
Reason: the JSR runtime compatibility claim is set by hand in the JSR web UI, so the only thing keeping it honest is a proof anyone can rerun

Rule: expect the proof to write nothing inside the repository
Reason: the sources are copied to a temporary directory and the install happens there, so a run cannot leave the tree dirty

Rule: do not create `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, or `.npmrc` in the repository to run the suites by hand
Reason: a `package.json` beside `deno.json` switches Deno to node-modules resolution, and `deno check` then fails with a missing `@types/node` for everyone who did not also install

Rule: rely on the temporary directory being removed even when a run fails
Reason: the cleanup is in a `finally`, so a failing runtime reports its output without stranding an install

Rule: pass `--keep` to leave the staging directory in place and print its path
Reason: reproducing a failure by hand needs the installed tree the failure happened in

Rule: expect a missing runtime to be reported and skipped rather than failing the run
Reason: a machine without Bun should still prove what it can, and the summary names what actually ran

Rule: read the summary as one line per runtime plus a verdict
Reason: each line carries the runtime, its version, and the pass and fail counts, so the evidence is the output rather than a claim about it

Rule: treat a run that passed nothing as a failure
Reason: a runtime that never loaded the files reports zero failures, which would otherwise read as success

Rule: keep the dependency list and the runtime versions in `runtimes.config.ts`, the parsing and formatting in `runtimes.report.ts`, and the IO in `runtimes.ts`
Reason: the report module tests without permissions while the entry owns the only spawn, copy, and temporary directory

Rule: update `dependencies` in `runtimes.config.ts` whenever an import is added to `deno.json`
Reason: the staged copy resolves imports through that manifest alone, so a missing entry fails the proof with a module not found

Rule: express a JSR dependency as its `npm:@jsr/...` alias in that manifest
Reason: Node and Bun resolve JSR packages through npm.jsr.io under the `@jsr` scope, which is what the generated `.npmrc` points at

Rule: do not read the proof as covering `src/index.test.ts`
Reason: it walks the docs with `Deno.readDir` to check every rule is documented, so it is a repository check rather than a test of the plugin and is scoped out in `runtimes.config.ts`

Rule: keep `process.cwd()` rather than `Deno.cwd()` in a test that needs the working directory
Reason: `describe-title-pattern` and `require-file-calls` build absolute paths, and `process.cwd()` is the spelling all three runtimes answer

Rule: record the result in the README rather than only in a terminal
Reason: a reader deciding whether to trust the JSR badge needs the versions and the counts in the repository

Rule: rerun the proof before bumping the version and update the README counts when they move
Reason: the recorded numbers are evidence for a specific release, so a stale count is worse than none
